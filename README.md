## Development notes

### Pre-commit hook

It is recommended that you install the hooks under `submodules/quickstart-atlassian-services/scripts/hooks/`; this will
ensure that the metadata tags in the templates are automatically updated on
commit. The simplest method of doing this is:

    git config --add core.hooksPath submodules/quickstart-atlassian-services/scripts/hooks/

Alternatively you can invoke
`submodules/quickstart-atlassian-services/scripts/hooks/update-tags.py`
manually.

## Atlassian support

This Quick Start's CloudFormation templates were developed by Atlassian, in collaboration with AWS. To report an issue or request a feature, you can [contact Atlassian directly](https://support.atlassian.com/contact/#/).
